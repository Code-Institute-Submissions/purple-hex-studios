## Code Validation


### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

| Page | W3C URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Home | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-home.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Contact | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Fcontact%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-contact.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Services | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Fservices%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-services.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Service detail  | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Fservices%2Fdetail%2F7%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-service-detail.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Edit Service  | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-edit-service.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Add Service | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-add-service.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Examples | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Fexamples%2F)| ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-examples.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Checkout | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Fcheckout%2F)| ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Bag | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Fbag%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-bag.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Profile | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-profile.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Login | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Faccounts%2Flogin%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-login.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| Sign Up | [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpurple-hex-studios.herokuapp.com%2Faccounts%2Fsignup%2F) | ![screenshot](documentation/html-validation-signup.png) | Pass: No Errors |


### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live site if you only have a single CSS file using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to the page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FThomG1.github.io%2Fpurple-hex-studios

If you have multiple CSS files, then individual [validation by input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
is recommended for the additional CSS files.

**IMPORTANT**: Third-Party tools

If you're using extras like Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, then sometimes the validator
will attempt to also validate this code, even if it's not part of your own actual code.
You are not required to validate the external libraries or frameworks!

Sample CSS code validation documentation (tables are extremely helpful!):

üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë END OF NOTES (to be deleted) üõëüõëüõëüõëüõë

| File | Jigsaw URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| style.css | [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FThomG1.github.io%2Fpurple-hex-studios) | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-style.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| checkout.css | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining CSS files |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

| File | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| countryfield.js | ![screenshot](documentation/js-validation-countryfield.png) | No errors |
| stripe_elements.js | ![screenshot](documentation/js-validation-stripe.png) | Undefined Stripe variable |


### Python

| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining Python files |

**IMPORTANT**: Django settings.py

The Django settings.py file comes with 4 lines that are quite long, and will throw the `E501 line too long` error.
This is default behavior, but can be fixed by adding `# noqa` to the end of those lines.

Example:

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]
```
